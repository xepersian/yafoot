# The yafoot Bundle
The `yafoot` is a bundle of miscellaneous footnote packages. It contains the following three packages:
 - `pfnote` to number footnotes per page;
 - `fnpos` to control the position of footnotes; and
 - `dblfnote` to make footnotes double-columned.

## Note

The official versions of the bundle are released on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/yafoot).
